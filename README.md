# Utah Elementary Teacher Training Assistant (UTAH-TTA)
## Second Grade Focus

An innovative educational training system integrated directly with Elementary Education program curriculum. This AI-powered platform allows education majors to practice and master teaching concepts through interactive simulations. Starting as a chatbot-based system (Phase 1), evolving to include voice interactions (Phase 2), and ultimately incorporating virtual reality experiences (Phase 3), UTAH-TTA provides a progressive learning environment where student teachers can apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. Each simulation is carefully crafted to align with specific teaching competencies and educational objectives from the teacher preparation program.

## Knowledge Base Integration

The Utah Teacher Training Assistant (UTTA) now integrates with an Educational Knowledge Base containing evidence-based educational content extracted from textbooks and research papers. This knowledge base powers the chatbot's ability to generate and evaluate teacher training scenarios.

### Knowledge Base Structure

The knowledge base is structured as follows:

```
knowledge_base/
├── vector_db.sqlite            # Main vector database (17,980 knowledge chunks)
├── knowledge.db                # Structured behavioral data
└── books/                      # Source educational materials
```

The vector database contains nearly 18,000 knowledge chunks categorized into:
- General Education
- Classroom Management
- Teaching Strategies
- Student Development

### Knowledge Base Location

The knowledge base is located at:
```
/home/team1/UTTA-Knowledge-Base-Demo/knowledge_base/vector_db.sqlite
```

The system is configured to directly access this location.

### Using the Knowledge Base

The knowledge base is integrated with the chatbot through the `KnowledgeRetriever` class, which provides the following functionality:

- Semantic search for relevant educational content
- Knowledge retrieval for generating scenarios
- Evidence-based evaluation of teacher responses
- Tracking of knowledge effectiveness

Example usage:

```python
from src.ai.knowledge_retriever import KnowledgeRetriever

# Initialize the knowledge retriever
retriever = KnowledgeRetriever()

# Search for relevant knowledge
results = retriever.search("classroom management strategies", top_k=3)

# Get knowledge categories
categories = retriever.get_categories()

# Get most effective knowledge
effective_knowledge = retriever.get_most_effective_knowledge(limit=5)
```

### Testing the Knowledge Base Integration

To test the knowledge base integration, run:

```bash
python tests/test_knowledge_retriever.py
```

This will verify that the knowledge base is properly connected and functioning.
