# Project Summary: Utah Teacher Training Assistant (UTAH-TTA)

## Addressing a Gap in Teacher Preparation

The Utah Teacher Training Assistant (UTAH-TTA) project was created to address a critical gap in the preparation of prospective elementary school teachers: the lack of realistic, low-risk opportunities to practice responding to real student behaviors and questions before entering a live classroom. Traditional teacher education programs focus heavily on pedagogy and theoretical coursework, but they often provide limited exposure to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of authentic student interactions, especially those encountered in early elementary grades. This gap creates anxiety, under preparedness, and a slower learning curve for student teachers when they finally engage with children during student teaching placements.

## An AI-Powered Simulated Child

To directly address this challenge, our team developed a chatbot simulation platform designed to mimic the conversational patterns, behaviors, and emotional expressions of a second-grade child. The chatbot serves as a training tool, enabling prospective teachers to engage in realistic back-and-forth interactions as if they were speaking with an actual student. This virtual child can ask questions, express confusion, respond emotionally, and even demonstrate age-appropriate misconceptions—all behaviors that future educators must be equipped to manage effectively. The system provides an environment where users can practice active listening, appropriate scaffolding, empathy, and clear instructional responses without fear of real-world consequences.

## A Curriculum-Aligned, Scalable Solution

Our solution is fully aligned with core competencies found in elementary education curriculum, with each custom simulation scenario designed around specific teaching objectives such as classroom management, instructional strategy, and child development. The chatbot leverages a custom AI model supported by an extensive educational knowledge base containing thousands of evidence-based content chunks from textbooks and research. By grounding simulations in academic rigor and practical pedagogy, the system ensures that student interactions are not only authentic but also educationally sound.

The UTAH-TTA platform is scalable across training programs and adaptable to future phases, including voice integration and immersive virtual reality. It will allow teacher candidates to receive immediate, personalized feedback on their responses and track their progress through targeted skill areas. Through this project, we’ve created a powerful new model for teacher training—one that blends innovative AI technology with research-driven educational practice to close a meaningful gap in teacher preparation.
