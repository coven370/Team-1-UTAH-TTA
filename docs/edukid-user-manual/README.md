   - Visit <https://www.uvu.edu/itservices/information-security/vpn_student-employee-access.html>.  
   - Complete and submit the VPN Access Request Form.  
   - Approval can take **24–48 hours**; you’ll receive an email once access is granted.

2. **Install Cisco AnyConnect**

## 4. Navigating the EduKid Interface

The left‑hand sidebar contains three primary modes:

| Mode | Purpose | Key Actions |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Scenarios** | Craft or load classroom situations to practice your responses. | • Click **Scenario** to set: Student Profiles, Academic Context, Environmental Challenges, Behavior Challenges, and Learning Objective<br>• Use **Randomize** to auto‑generate any field.<br>• Browse **Pre‑Made Scenarios** and click on one to begin chatting. |
| **Improve** | Help refine the chatbot’s second‑grader persona. | • The bot posts candidate statements.<br>• Rate each with **Good**, **Neutral**, or **Bad**.<br>• Your feedback updates the model’s style metrics. |
| **Reference** | Ask teaching or student‑behavior questions. | • Type a question (e.g., “How do I handle off‑task students?”).<br>• The chatbot searches its knowledge base and responds with evidence‑based guidance. |


---

## 5. Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start Simple** – Try a premade scenario first to see how the bot behaves.  
2. **Iterate** – After finishing a scenario, adjust one parameter at a time (e.g., behavior challenge) to practice targeted responses.  
3. **Leverage “Reference”** – When unsure about best practices, ask the bot mid‑session for on‑the‑spot guidance.  
4. **Rate Consistently** – In *Improve* mode, use consistent criteria when scoring messages; this speeds model refinement.  
5. **Stay on VPN** – Dropping your VPN connection will interrupt chat sessions; reconnect and refresh the page if needed.

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| EduKid site won’t load | • Confirm VPN status is “Connected.”<br>• Try <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> to hard‑refresh.<br>• Disable browser extensions that block scripts. |
| Chatbot stops responding | • Check internet stability.<br>• Click **Restart** in the chat window.<br>• Reconnect VPN and reload the page. |
| Scenario settings don’t save | • Ensure you clicked **Save Scenario** before navigating away.<br>• Clear browser cache and try again. |
